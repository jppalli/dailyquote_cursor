# Sound Files for Daily Quote Puzzle

This folder contains the audio files used in the game. 

## Required Sound Files:

### Current Sounds:
- `keytype.mp3` or `keytype.wav` - Typewriter key press sound (plays when typing letters)
- `word-complete.mp3` - Sound when a word is completed
- `author-complete.mp3` - Sound when author is revealed
- `reset.mp3` - Sound when reset button is clicked
- `quote-complete.mp3` - Sound when entire quote puzzle is solved
- `background-music.mp3` - Looping background music (starts on game load)

### Future Sound Ideas:
- `button-click.mp3` - Sound for button interactions
- `word-activate.mp3` - Sound when clicking on a scrambled word
- `error.mp3` - Sound for incorrect attempts
- `celebration.mp3` - Victory sound for puzzle completion

## Audio Format Recommendations:
- Use MP3 for broad compatibility
- Keep file sizes small (under 100KB each)
- Use short sounds (0.1-0.5 seconds for typing, 1-3 seconds for celebrations)
- Normalize volume levels across all sounds

## Sound Style:
- Vintage/retro sounds that match the newspaper aesthetic
- Typewriter sounds for key presses
- Subtle, pleasant sounds that enhance rather than distract
- Consider using actual typewriter recordings for authenticity
